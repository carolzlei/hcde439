                Here is my breadboard with 2 LED lights and a button that controls those LEDs.

            Assignment
            </h3>
            <p>
            For this assignment, I connected 2 LED's to a button on my breadboard.
                On this board, the button controls which LED is turned on.
                When the button is unclicked, the white LED is on. 
                When the button is clicked, the RGB LED fades in colors. 
            </p>
    
            <h3>
            The Schematic
            </h3>
            <p>

            <p>
            This is the schematic for my LED lights fading. 
                I am using Ohm's Law, V=IR, to calculate the resistance needed for 20 mA curent to flow through each of the LEDs.
                I have done two calculations for the two voltage drops that are seen in the LED lights, 
                blue and white see a 3.3V drop, while red, yellow, and green see a 1.8V drop. 
                Because I do not have resistors with the exact values 85 and 160 ohms, I used 100 ohms for the white LED and 220 ohms for the RGB LED. 

                <br> 
                For the button that is connected to Pin2, it is reading either a HIGH or a LOW when clicked and defaulted unclicked, respectively. 
                For this button and circuit, a 10K resistor is standard for the 5V on this Arduino. When the button is unclicked, there will be no electricity flowing through the button betweent the resistance is so strong.  
                When the switch is closed (button is clicked), there is a 0.5 mA of current through the button.
