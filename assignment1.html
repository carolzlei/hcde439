            Assignment
            </h3>
            <p>
            For this assignment, I connected five LED's to a button on my breadboard. 
                When the button is pressed, the LED's will light one-by-one each for 200 milliseconds. 
                The LED lights light up in the following order â€“ blue, yellow, green, red and white.
            </p>

            The Schematic

            This is the schematic for my LED blinking. I have connected the 5 LEDs on the Arduino pins 9 to 13.
                I am using Ohm's Law, V=IR, to calculate the resistance needed for 20 mA curent to flow through each of the LEDs. 
                I have done two calculations for the two voltage drops that are seen in the LED lights. 
                Blue and white see a 3.3V drop, while red, yellow, and green see a 1.8V drop.

            This is the code I used to develop the behavior I wanted. See the comments in the code for further explanations.
